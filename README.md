This is the code that I wrote for WorldSkillsUK 2024 in Manchester. Each module was written in 3 hours with no access to the internet. 

- [Module A](/module-a)
Module A was a design implementation challenge. I chose to write this with pure html/css/js instead of a framework, partly due to teething issues but also because the design couldn't easily be split down into components.

- [Module B](/module-b)
Module B was a Frontend challenge. We had an existing table and had to add feautres to it like sorting, searching and filtering as well as lazy loading the data. I was the only competitor who got the marks for adding the provided header, footer, favicon and title.

- [Module C](/module-c) 
By far my favourite module, we had to write and implement a backend for an existing frontend. Out of the provided frameworks, I chose to use laravel. I got every feature required to work, apart from my forms becuase I forgot to include the name attribute on my html, which likely lost me a place or two on the leaderbaord.

- [Module D](/module-d)
For this module we had to build small snippets for frontend code. I've hosted it over at [playgrounds](https://playgrounds.sambot.dev) so that you can take a look at what I did, i'm particularly pleased with my sunrise animation, buggy as it is, it achieved full marks.
